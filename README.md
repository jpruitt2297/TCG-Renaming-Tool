# TCG-Renaming-Tool
A simple tool for altering TCG Card Shop Simulator mods.

Forked from [Bobtelington's TCG Renaming Tool](https://github.com/bobtelington/TCG-Renaming-Tool) or [TCG Renaming Tool on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/tcgcardshopsimulator/mods/145).

Added support for all 19 playmats (as of 10/31/24). Two playmats in-game share the same name file, so there is one selection option that doesn't have a name file requirement.
